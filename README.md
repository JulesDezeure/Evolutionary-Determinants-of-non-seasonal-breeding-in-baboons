You will find an excel file with all the data used in this study (table named 'Baboon_Asynchrony_TABLES'). Various tables are found in each excel tab, and a legand tab is available, describing the meanings of all columns of each tab. The legend of the 'Conception_Table' is available in the legend tab of the excel file 'Baboon_Asynchrony_TABLES'. 

In addition, we attached the main R scripts used in this study, with clear annotations, so that the methodology to run the full models presented in main text can be accomplished.
