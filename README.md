Data and R script repository 

You will find an excel file with all the data used in this study (table named 'Baboon_Asynchrony_TABLES'). Various tables are found in each excel tab, and a legand tab is available, describing the meanings of all columns of each tab. The legend of the 'Conception_Table' is available in the legend tab of the excel file 'Baboon_Asynchrony_TABLES'. 

In addition, we attached the main R scripts used in this study, with clear annotations, so that the methodology to run the full models presented in main text can be accomplished (see the files 'Model_1', 'Model_2' and 'Model_3'). Note that the scripts of the Model 1 (on interbirth intervals) is very detailed, and one must thus refers to this script in some steps of model selection to understand the scripts used in Model 2. Similarly, we only detailed the steps and procedures of Model 3 on cycle resumption probability, as the Model 4 (on conception probabilities) follow the exact same methodology as Model 3.  

The code for the simulations presented in Appendix E is available in 'Model Appendice E.R' file, along with the code necessary to create Figures S3 and S4. The two csv files named 'Births_distribution' and 'Extract_ModelIBI_Rank_Synchro_Interaction' are used only for these simulations. 

Finally, we presented in the R script named 'Figure script' the code used to create the figures presented in the paper.
